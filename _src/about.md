Hi! My name is Eric Griffis. I love programming language design, collaborative
software, electronic music, photography, and mathematics.

I am currently a pre-candidate PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, advised by Professor [Cyrus Omar](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar/)
in the [Future of Programming Lab](http://fplab.mplse.org/), where we work on
[Hazel](http://hazel.org/), the structured programming language and editor.

My research interests lie at the intersection of formal methods, programming
languages, and interactive systems. My focus is on developing theoretical
foundations and reducing technical barriers for scalable, intelligent,
data-intensive, collaborative software platforms and ecosystems.
