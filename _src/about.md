Hi! My name is Eric Griffis. I love programming language design, collaborative
software, electronic music, digital photography, and mathematics.

I am currently a pre-candidate PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, advised by Professor [Cyrus Omar](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar/)
in the [Future of Programming Lab](http://fplab.mplse.org/), where we work on
[Hazel](http://hazel.org/), the structured programming language and editor.

My research interests lie at the intersection of formal methods, programming
languages, and interactive systems. My focus is on developing theoretical
foundations and reducing technical barriers for scalable, intelligent,
data-intensive, collaborative software platforms and ecosystems. In the
future, I'd like to build Internet-scale decentralized virtual worlds.

In the [Future of Programming Lab](http://fplab.mplse.org/), I am currently
involved in two projects that extend [Hazel](http://hazel.org/) (the language)
or use [Hazel](http://hazel.org/) (the editor) as a research platform. *Grove*
is a lambda calculus for conflict-free collaborative structure editing.
*Shmyth* extends Hazel with an interactive program synthesizer based on the
[Smyth](https://github.com/UChicago-PL/smyth) synthesizer.

I am also an active open source developer. See the [Projects](/projects) page
for a list of [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) packages I'm working on.
