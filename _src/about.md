My name is Eric Griffis and I am an intuitive programmer.

I've been kicking around the Los Angeles tech scene since 1996, building
Web apps, wrangling data, and architecting software process networks for a
diverse clientele including major Internet/Web service providers,
aerospace engineering firms, high-profile entertainment outlets, and
artificial intelligence and robotics startups.

A few years ago, I decided to embrace the "dark side" of programming --
the messy pursuit of high-risk, high-reward results through
intuition-munging exploratory programming, as opposed to more traditional
approaches (e.g., measure twice, cut once) taught in undergraduate
software engineering courses.

To get a better idea of what I've been up to, take a look at my
[CV](https://dedbox.github.io/cv/) or
